To build and run the Dream Candies File Tool,

$ make
$ ./extractor

with expected 'CUSTOMER.CSV', 'INVOICE.CSV' and 'INVOICE_ITEM.CSV' 
full database CSV extracts in the same path along with the pre-
selected 1000 customer codes located in 'CUSTOMER_SAMPLE.CSV'.

All file parameters and header values can be changed in macros 
under 'extractor.cpp' if necessary.
